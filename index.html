      <div class="col-lg-6 mx-auto">
        <p class="lead mb-4">The MRD Percussion section is a group of highly talented percussionists at James Madison University. As members of the Marching Royal Dukes, the MRD Percussion 
          section are liasons for the musical excellence found at JMU. We serve the university by going to high school competitions to advertise the univeristy to high schoolers interested 
          in going to the university.
        </p>
        <p class="lead mb-4">James Madison University is one of few colleges/universities that have a full percussion section in the marching band. Most marching bands don't have a front 
          ensemble, and some of them do not have a cymbal section in the drumline; the Marching Royal Dukes believe that anyone who wants to continue marching band in college should be free 
          to do so, and in order to meet that belief, we provide several ways for percussionists to continue in band.
        </p>
        <p class="lead mb-4">As one of two sections of the Marching Royal Dukes that need to be auditioned into, the ensemble is competitive and the best percussionists compose the 
          group. The audition process for the ensemble drives members to keep practicing through the offseasons and make sure that the strongest drumline is created every season.
