          <p class="lead mb-4">Here are the key things to think about during your shoot.</p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="mx-auto">
        <h2>1. Take Your Time</h2>
        <p class="lead mb-4">In a session, we want our subjects to feel comfortable for more personable photos. Make sure that you go with the flow and take your time so they don't feel rushed.</p>
        
        <h2>2. Eyes</h2>
        <p class="lead mb-4">A good way to tell if your subject is in focus is in their eyes. Zoom in on their eyes and adjust your focus to them.</p>
        
        <h2>3. Telephoto Lens</h2>
        <p class="lead mb-4">Wider lenses will change the way your subject looks. Put distance between you and the subect and zoom in with a telephoto lense to get the shot you want.</p>
        
        <h2>4. Know Poses</h2>
        <p class="lead mb-4">While the subject should be the star of the photo shoot, you should guide them on what poses to take to make sure they look how they want in their photos. Guide them through the best poses that you think you want; if one doesn't work out, just delete it.</p>
        
        <h2>5. Background</h2>
        <p class="lead mb-4">The background takes up a signifcant portion of the photo. Make sure it's something that contrasts well with the subject and is relevant to the subject as well as aesthetically pleasing.</p>
        
        <h2>6. Sharp Object, Soft Background</h2>
        <h4 class="fst-italic">Higher aperture recommended</h4>
        <p class="lead mb-4">The photos have to have the priority on the subject. Having some bokoh on the background is great to help guide the eyes to the subject and make sure that they're the highlight of the photo.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="container my-5">
        <div class="bg-sage row p-4 pb-0 pe-lg-0 pt-lg-5 align-items-center rounded-3 border shadow-lg">
          <h1 class="display-4 fw-bold lh-1 text-center">Advanced Tools</h1>

          <div class="col-lg-7 p-3 p-lg-5 pt-lg-3">
            <br>
            <div class="mx-auto">
              <h2>1. Diffuse Light</h2>
              <p class="lead mb-4">Sharp lights won't reflect pretty on the skin or glasses of your subject. Having diffused, soft light will make sure that the light appears more natural.</p>
              
              <h2>2. Creative Lighting</h2>
              <p class="lead mb-4">Generally you want your subject to be well lit, but using less lights, unique lighting or different color lights will change the mood and meaning of the photo.</p>
              
              <h2>3. Props</h2>
              <p class="lead mb-4">Props can help tell a story or share more information about the subject. Graduation caps or instruments can share information with the audience without saying anything.</p>
              
              <h2>4. Editing</h2>
              <p class="lead mb-4">Your photos--and subject--will come to life in the editing process. Color grading and modifying tone curves can change so much about the mood of the image and helps acheive the look you desire.</p>
              
              <h2>5. Get Creative</h2>
              <p class="lead mb-4">In the time you and your subject have, take as many pictures as you can. Try out different, unique shots and get as many different perspectives as possible.</p>
