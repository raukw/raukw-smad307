        <h1 class="display-5 fw-bold">During The Shoot</h1>
        <div class="col-lg-6 mx-auto">
          <p class="lead mb-4">Here are the key functions to adjust during your shoot.</p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="mx-auto">
        <h2>1. Fast Shutter Speed</h2>
        <h4 class="fst-italic">1/1000 seconds recommended</h4>
        <p class="lead mb-4">To freeze the action, you'll need to have a high shutter speed. You want it to be fast enough where the subject is focused and not blurry, but not too fast that there's not enough light coming to the sensor.</p>
        
        <h2>2. White Balance</h2>
        <h4 class="fst-italic">Auto recommended</h4>
        <p class="lead mb-4">Modern cameras do a great job adjusting the white balance to what's going on in real life. We want our action to be as representative to real life as possible, so keep the color balance auto.</p>
        
        <h2>3. Avoid Flash</h2>
        <p class="lead mb-4">In sports, we are not the action everyone is looking at: the focus of the event is on the players. We must make sure we don't distract the players or interfere in the game, and sometimes flash photography can cause that. In darker settings, be prepared to turn up the ISO to bring in more light.</p>
        
        <h2>4. Continuous Shooting Mode</h2>
        <p class="lead mb-4">Also known as burst mode, continuos shooting allows you to take many photos rapidly. Taking more photos of the action is better because you want to have more options to choose from when exporting your photos; even a split second makes a huge difference in a photo.</p>
        
        <h2>5. Servo AF/Subject Tracking</h2>
        <p class="lead mb-4">By default, you camera will refocuse with every shot. Having Servo AF turned on will allow you to keep your subject in focus so long as you half hold the shutter. This allows you to follow them in action without wasting time refocusing.</p>

          <h1 class="display-4 fw-bold lh-1 text-center">Advanced Tools</h1>

          <div class="col-lg-7 p-3 p-lg-5 pt-lg-3">
            <br>
            <div class="mx-auto">
              <h2>1. JPEGs</h2>
              <p class="lead mb-4">Raw photos are great because the larger image files have more data, allowing for deeper edits. In sports, we need to take pictures as fast as we can; taking images as JPEGs takes just a little less time to write and save than Raw photos, allowing you to take photos quicker.</p>
              
              <h2>2. Spectators</h2>
              <p class="lead mb-4">Capturing the magic of sports goes beyond the players. The passion of fans or the size of large crowds can show how meaningful the sport is to them. Capture them to show the passion of the sport.</p>
              
              <h2>3. Long Zoom Lense</h2>
              <p class="lead mb-4">Being far away from the action, you'll need to get a much larger zoom lense. This will allow you to be out of physical harm from the sports and not interfere in the event.</p>
              
              <h2>4. Unipod</h2>
              <p class="lead mb-4">With the large lenses, the camera will get heavier and heavier. We recommend having a unipod to help keep the camera steady and distribute the weight without compromising mobility that a tripod would take away from you.</p>
              
              <h2>5. Don't Crop Limbs</h2>
              <p class="lead mb-4">When capture athletes, it's important to make sure that you don't cut out any of their body parts. It makes the pictures just a little more complete and more professional.</p>
              
              <h2>6. Don't Chimp</h2>
              <p class="lead mb-4">Chimping is when the photographer looks at their images after taking them. In sports, it's important to be following the action; if you put down the camera to look at the picture, you could be missing a potentially great shot on the field.</p>
